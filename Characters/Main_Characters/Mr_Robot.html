    <p>Mr. Robot is the co-founder and leader of the hacker group fsociety, a revolutionary prophet who plans to bring down the world's largest conglomerate. Though he is intelligent and charismatic, Mr. Robot is also emotionally manipulative, and can be quick to violence. This has prompted comparisons to the behavior of militant cult leaders.  </p>
        <p>It eventually becomes clear that Mr. Robot is a construct within Elliot Alderson's mind. (“eps1.8_m1rr0r1ng.qt”) His persona is an idealized representation of Elliot's deceased father, Edward; where Edward was unwilling or unable to take action, Mr. Robot was created to inspire war against E Corp and incite historical change. In some situations, Mr. Robot will take control and act through Elliot, thus explaining his direct interactions with other people.</p>   
        <p>Mr. Robot is played by Christian Slater. </p>

<h3><u>Trivia</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>In several episodes, Mr. Robot can be seen reading Leo Tolstoy's Resurrection, and throughout Season 2, a copy is visible in Elliot's room. The story follows a nobleman named Nekhlyudov who gradually comes to recognize the social, economic and legal oppression heaped upon the lower classes.</li>
    <li>In the season 3 final Elliot tells Mr. Robot that he missed him and the reason why they were not able to talk the whole time wasn't because he refused to talk, but it was because he was afraid of Mr. Robot and because he couldn't get over that fear he ended up locking Mr. Robot away unable to talk to him. Only when he got over his fear could they talk.</li>
